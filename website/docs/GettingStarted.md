The purpose of this document is to provide a quick entry point for users
desiring to quickly run a StreamDM task. We describe how StreamDM can be
compiled, and how a quick task can be run.

The basic requirement for running the example in this documents is to have Spark
1.4 installed. The example works best on a Linux/Unix machine.

## Compiling The Code

In the main folder of StreamDM, the following command generates the package
needed to run StreamDM:

```bash
sbt package
```

## Running The Task

The task that is run in this example is the EvaluatePrequential. By default, the
task connects to a socket open on the localhost at port 9999 which sends dense
instances as a stream. Then a linear binary classifier is trained by using
StochasticGradientDescent and the predictions are evaluted by outputting the
confusion matrix.

The example can be run by executing the following steps:

* In the first terminal: create the dataset syn.dat (only needed once); this
  script will generate a file containing dense instances of 3 features:

  {% highlight bash %}
  cd scripts/instance_server
  ./generate_dataset.py
  {% endhighlight %}

* After, in one terminal, start the server sending instances in syn.dat into
  port 9999 on localhost; this stream will be read by the task:

  {% highlight bash %}
  cd scripts/instance_server
  ./server.py
  {% endhighlight %}

* In another terminal, use the provided spark script to run the task (after
  modifying the `SPARK_HOME` variable with the folder of your Spark installation):

  {% highlight bash %}
  cd scripts
  ./spark.sh
  {% endhighlight %}

* It is possible to add command-line options to specify task, learner, and evaluation parameters:
 
  {% highlight bash %}
  cd scripts
  ./spark.sh "EvaluatePrequential -l (SGDLearner -l 0.01 -o LogisticLoss -r ZeroRegularizer)"
  {% endhighlight %}

* [Optional] It is advisable to separate the standard and the error output, for
  better readability:

  {% highlight bash %}
  cd scripts
  ./spark.sh 1>results.txt 2>debug.log
  {% endhighlight %}

The standard output will contain a confusion matrix aggregating the prediction
results for every Spark RDD in the stream.
